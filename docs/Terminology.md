## Terminology

### Remotes, full paths, base names, etc.

#### For a file:

Suppose we have the file `foo.src` in this location: `gdrive:users/OddThinking/Documents/My Source/Widget/foo.src`

Then,

- Its 'remote' is `gdrive`
- Its 'full path' is `users/OddThinking/Documents/My Source/Widget/foo.src`
- Its 'directory path' is `users/OddThinking/Documents/My Source/Widget`
- Its 'base name' or 'file name' is `foo.src`
- Its 'file extension' is `src` (without the dot)

#### For a folder:

Now, suppose we have the folder `Pictures` in this location: `gdrive:users/OddThinking/Documents/My Source/Widget/Pictures`

Then,

- Its 'remote' is `gdrive`
- Its 'full path' is `users/OddThinking/Documents/My Source/Widget/Pictures`
- Its 'directory path' is `users/OddThinking/Documents/My Source/Widget/Pictures`
- Its 'base name' or 'folder name' is `Pictures`
- It does nott have a file extension
