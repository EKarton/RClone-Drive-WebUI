### Description:

- [x] See images and files in detail
- [x] View and scroll through all pictures recursively (like Google Photos) with lazy-loading
- [x] Upload files and folders easily via drag-and-drop with good performance (using web workers)
- [x] Copy and move files between and within remotes with good performance (using web workers)
- [x] Delete files with good performance (using web workers)
- [x] Set theme to dark mode
- [x] Clear trash can on selected cloud providers and remotes
- [ ] Search for files and images across remotes

### Setup / Getting Started:

1. Install dependencies by running `yarn install`
2. Start your RClone instance:

   1. If your RClone config is in its [default location](https://rclone.org/docs/#:~:text=The%20exact%20default%20is%20a%20bit%20complex%20to%20describe%2C%20due%20to%20changes%20introduced%20through%20different%20versions%20of%20rclone%20while%20preserving%20backwards%20compatibility%2C%20but%20in%20most%20cases%20it%20is%20as%20simple%20as%3A), run:

      ```
      rclone rcd --rc-allow-origin '*' --rc-user='local' --rc-pass="1234" --rc-serve
      ```

   2. Else, if it is in a different location, run:

      ```
